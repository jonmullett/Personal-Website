    <h1>Jon Mullett</h1>
    <h2>Who</h2>
<div>
    </p>I'm Jonathan Michael Mullett, or in one sylable "Jon". I'm origonally from Minneapolis, Minnesota and moved to Colorado to get my Bachelors in Technical Journalism and Economics. Most recently (2024), I graduated from Colorado State University and Fullstack Acadamy's Coding Bootcamp. The front-end and back-end coding of this website was designed, developed and programmed by yours truly. </p>
        
    </p>After achieving my Bachelors from Colorado State Unitversity I landed at the Colorado Lottery. I served in various marketing roles throughout my time there, including Inistant Ticket Product Manager, Online-Game Drawing Manager, and Public Affairs Cordinator. After 9 years at the Lottery, I accepted a position to serve as the first marketing manager for Snaptron, Inc., an upcoming company serving the electronics industry. Upon arrival at Snaptron, a staff of 30 generated XXX in annual sales. When I left 16 years later, sales totaled XXX and the staff more than trippled. In 2020, I created Mullett Marketing, providing freelance digital marketing services and consulting. </p>

    <h2>What</h2>
    <div>
    <p>I'm looking to get back to the private sector. Although I've enjoyed being selft employed I feel I can be a valuable asset in the private sector. I have recently graduated from Colorado State University's codding bootcamp, which is an intensive 6-month program to become certified in coding disaplines including html, css, and javascript.</p>
</div>
    <h2>When</h2>
    <div>
    <p>I am available to join my next team in 2-3 weeks. That said, I can begin getting up to speed immediately.</p>
</div>
    <h2>Where</h2>
    <div>
    <p>I am looked in Fort Collins, which nessles up to the Rocky Mountain foothills in northern Colorado. Fort Collins is about an hours drive from Denver International Airport.I am available to work locally or remotely. </p>
</div>
    <h2>Why</h2>
    <div>
    <p>There are peaks and valleys when being self-employed. While the peaks are glorious, the valleys are arduous. I'm ready to get back to being a piece of a team whose individual talents combine to the reach the goals and mission of the company.  </p>
