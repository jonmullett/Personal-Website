    <h2>Who</h2>
  </div>

    <div>
      <p>
        I'm Jonathan Michael Mullett, or in one sylable "Jon". I'm origonally
        from Minneapolis, Minnesota and moved to Colorado to get my Bachelors in
        Technical Journalism and Economics. Most recently (2024), I graduated
        from Colorado State University and Fullstack Acadamy's Coding Bootcamp.
        The front-end and back-end coding of this website was designed,
        developed and programmed by yours truly.
      </p>

      <p>
        After achieving my Bachelors from Colorado State Unitversity I landed at
        the Colorado Lottery. I served in various marketing roles throughout my
        time there, including Inistant Ticket Product Manager, Online-Game
        Drawing Manager, and Public Affairs Cordinator. After 9 years at the
        Lottery, I accepted a position to serve as the first marketing manager
        for Snaptron, Inc., an upcoming company serving the electronics
        industry. Upon arrival at Snaptron, a staff of 30 generated XXX in
        annual sales. When I left 16 years later, sales totaled XXX and the
        staff more than trippled. In 2020, I created Mullett Marketing,
        providing freelance digital marketing services and consulting.

    <h2>What</h2>
  </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        I'm looking to get back to the private sector. Although I've enjoyed
        being selft employed I feel I can be a valuable asset in the private
        sector. I have recently graduated from Colorado State University's
        codding bootcamp, which is an intensive 6-month program to become
        certified in coding disaplines including html, css, and javascript.

    <h2>When</h2>
  </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        I am available to join my next team in 2-3 weeks. That said, I can begin
        getting up to speed immediately.
      </p>
    </div>
    <div class="fivew">
    <h2>Where</h2>
  </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        I am looked in Fort Collins, which nessles up to the Rocky Mountain
        foothills in northern Colorado. Fort Collins is about an hours drive from Denver International Airport.I am available to work locally or
        remotely.
      </p>

    <div class="fivew">
    <h2>Why</h2>
  </div>
    <div>
      <p>
        There are peaks and valleys when being self-employed. While the peaks are glorious, the valleys are arduous. I'm ready to get back to being a piece of a team whose individual talents combine to the reach the goals
        and mission of the company.
